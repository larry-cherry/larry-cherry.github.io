    				I have many Hobbies but one of my favorite is <em>gardening</em>

    					<p>
    						I have been gardening for over 2 years now. The growing season is coming to an end, but I am already starting on a few new plants for next session. The images below are a few pictures of the early sprouts I am preparing for next year. These plants will take several weeks to grow and I am working on having these close to maturity when the growing season starts this spring.

    						<p>
    							In this photo we have <Strong>Husk Cherry Tomatoes</Strong>. Now they are now actually tomatoes and are related to tomatillos. These berries have a husked fruit that has a pinapple taste. Can be difficult to start so I am glad I have three.

    						<p>
    							For those that are into health trends you may have heard of this plant before. <strong>Black Kale</strong> is leafy green plant and is a great substitute for spinach or lettuce. Once established this is a hardy plant.

    						Stay tuned for more updates. I will be posting pictures of my <em>Sun Choke</em> and my <em>Cherokee Black Beans</em> later this week once the weather in my area lightens up.
