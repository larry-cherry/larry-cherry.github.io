    					<p>
    						I have been gardening for over 2 years now. The growing season is coming to an end, but I am already starting on a few new plants for next session. The images below are a few pictures of the early sprouts I am preparing for next year. These plants will take several weeks to grow and I am working on having these close to maturity when the growing season starts this spring.

    							This is a photo of a Farmer's Jalapeno. In courage you to look up this guy and you may be surprised what it looks like.

    						<p>
    							In this photo we have Husk Cherry tomatoes. Now they are now actually tomatoes and are related to tomatillos. These berries have a husked fruit that has a pinapple taste. Can be difficult to start so I am glad I have three.

    						<p>
    							For those that are into health trends you may have heard of this plant before. Black Kale is leafy green plant and is a great substitute for spinach or lettuce. Once established this is a hardy plant.

    						Stay tuned for more updates. I will be posting pictures of my Sun Choke and my Cherokee Black Beans later this week once the weather in my area lightens up.
